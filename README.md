### Project Description
A Wizard's tale is the result of a three week full-time school project. The assignment was to create a game with balanced positive and negative feedback loops.

A Wizard's tale is a third person action tower defense like game made with Unity. It is inspired by games like Orcs Must Die and Dungeon Defenders. In the game the player must find and return crystals to a main crystal. After collecting a crystal a portal opens at that location from which enemies appear. The enemies will try to destroy the main crystal or kill the player if he comes to close to them. Depending on the crystal a player would return the player would get a different permanent power-up.

### My Responsibilities
During the project I was responsible for the following things:
 - Organisation
 - Gameplay
 - User Interface functionality
 - Background music implementation 
 - Soud effect implementation
 - Tracking statistics

**Organisation**
I made sure there were clear tasks for the programmers, discussing tasks with designers if something wasn't clear and adjusting tasks if necessary. Writing explanations/tutorials for designers for tools I created.

**Coding**
I experimented with scriptable objects during this project. Seeing how they can be used to make it easier for designers to change aspects of the game.<br>
It taught me some easy ways to pass data around that needs to be updated from specific places and used in others.
